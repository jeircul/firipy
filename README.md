Firipy is a Python client for the Firi API.

## üì¶ Installation

You can install Firipy using pip:

```bash
pip install firipy
```

## üöÄ Usage

First, import the `FiriAPI` class from the `firipy` module:

```python
from firipy import FiriAPI
```

Then, initialize the client with your API token from [Firi](https://platform.firi.com/):

```python
client = FiriAPI("your-token")
```

Now you can use the client to interact with the Firi API. For example, to get the current time:

```python
time = client.time()
print(time)
```

To get history over all transactions:

```python
history = client.history_transactions()
print(history)
```

To get balances:

```python
balances = client.balances()
print(balances)
```

### Using as a context manager

Automatically closes the underlying HTTP session when done:

```python
from firipy import FiriAPI

with FiriAPI("your-token") as client:
    markets = client.markets()
    print(markets)
```

## ‚è≥ Rate Limiting

Firipy includes a rate limit (seconds to sleep before each request). By default this is 1 second.
You can change it or disable it:

```python
client = FiriAPI("your-token", rate_limit=2)  # wait 2 seconds between requests
client_fast = FiriAPI("your-token", rate_limit=0)  # no client-side delay
```

## üö© Error Handling

Structured exceptions are raised by default:

| Exception | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `FiriAPIError` | Base class for client errors |
| `FiriHTTPError` | Non-success HTTP responses (status >=400) |

Suppress exceptions by setting `raise_on_error=False`:

```python
client = FiriAPI("your-token", raise_on_error=False)
data = client.markets()
if "error" in data:
    print("Failed:", data)
```

Error dict shape: `{ "error": str, "status": int | None }`.

Legacy camelCase address methods (e.g. `eth_Address`) are deprecated‚Äîuse `eth_address`. They emit a `DeprecationWarning` and will be removed in a future release.

## üì° Endpoint Overview (selection)

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose | Key Optional Params |
|--------|----------|---------|---------------------|
| `time()` | `/time` | Server time | ‚Äì |
| `markets()` | `/v2/markets` | List markets | ‚Äì |
| `markets_market(m)` | `/v2/markets/{m}` | Market details | ‚Äì |
| `markets_market_depth(m, bids=None, asks=None)` | `/v2/markets/{m}/depth` | Order book | `bids`, `asks` |
| `markets_market_history(m, count=None)` | `/v2/markets/{m}/history` | Market trade history | `count` |
| `markets_market_ticker(m)` | `/v2/markets/{m}/ticker` | Single ticker | ‚Äì |
| `markets_tickers()` | `/v2/markets/tickers` | All tickers | ‚Äì |
| `balances()` | `/v2/balances` | Wallet balances | ‚Äì |
| `history_transactions(count=None, direction=None)` | `/v2/history/transactions` | Transactions history | `count`, `direction` (`start`/`end`) |
| `history_orders(type=None, count=None)` | `/v2/history/orders` | Orders history | `type`, `count` |
| `deposit_history(count=None, before=None)` | `/v2/deposit/history` | Deposit history | `count`, `before` |
| `orders()` | `/v2/orders` | Active orders | ‚Äì |
| `orders_market(m, count=None)` | `/v2/orders/{m}` | Active orders (market) | `count` |
| `orders_market_history(m, count=None)` | `/v2/orders/{m}/history` | Closed orders (market) | `count` |
| `orders_history(count=None)` | `/v2/orders/history` | Closed orders | `count` |
| `order(order_id)` | `/v2/order/{id}` | Get order | ‚Äì |
| `post_orders(market, type, price, amount)` | `/v2/orders` | Create order | ‚Äì |
| `delete_orders()` | `/v2/orders` | Cancel all orders | ‚Äì |
| `delete_order_detailed(order_id, market=None)` | `/v2/orders/{id}/detailed` | Cancel order + matched amt | `market` |
| `coin_address(symbol)` | `/v2/{symbol}/address` | Coin deposit address | `symbol` (e.g. BTC) |
| `coin_withdraw_pending(symbol)` | `/v2/{symbol}/withdraw/pending` | Pending withdrawals | `symbol` |

Defaults like `count` fall back to 500 (internal `DEFAULT_COUNT`) when omitted. A warning is emitted if you go above the internal `MAX_COUNT` (10,000) so you can reconsider the request size.

### Deprecated Methods

| Deprecated | Replacement | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| `eth_Address`, `dai_Address`, `dot_Address`, `btc_Address`, `ada_Address` | snake_case variants | Legacy camelCase kept temporarily |
| `delete_orders_orderid_market_detailed` | `delete_order_detailed(order_id, market=...)` | Shorter, clearer |
| `delete_orders_orderid_detailed` | `delete_order_detailed(order_id)` | Shorter, clearer |
| `delete_orders_marketormarketsid` | `delete_orders_for_market` | Better naming |
| `history_trades*` | (pending removal) | Not present in current public docs |

All deprecated methods emit `DeprecationWarning` and will be removed in a future minor release (track the CHANGELOG for timelines).

### Generic Coin Helpers

Instead of calling `btc_address()`, `eth_address()`, etc. directly you can write:

```python
client.coin_address("BTC")
client.coin_withdraw_pending("ETH")
```

Concrete per-asset helpers remain for convenience.

```bash
task install       # create venv & install deps
task lint          # ruff checks
task typecheck     # mypy
task test          # run tests
task coverage      # coverage report
task release-check # lint + typecheck + coverage + build
```
